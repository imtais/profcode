    <br>
    <section>
    I brought a knife to a gunfight <br>
    My castle crumbled overnight <br>
    They took the crown, but it's alright <br>
    All the liars are calling me one <br>
    Nobody's heard from me for months <br>
    I'm doing better than I ever was <br>
    <br>
    'Cause my baby's fit like a daydream <br>
    Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to <br>
    So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br>
    My baby's fly like a jet stream <br>
    High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new <br>
    So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br>
    <br>
    All my flowers grew back as thorns <br>
     Windows boarded up after the storm <br>
    He built a fire just to keep me warm <br>
    All the drama queens taking swings <br>
    All the jokers dressin' up as kings <br>
    They fade to nothin' when I look at him <br>
    <br>
    And I know I make the same mistakes every time <br>
    Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right <br>
    I did one thing right <br>
    I'm laughin' with my lover, makin' forts under covers <br>
    Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right <br>
    Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night <br>
    <br>
    My baby's fit like a daydream <br>
    Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to <br>
    So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br>
    My baby's fly like a jet stream <br>
    High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new <br>
    (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it) <br>
    So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br>
    <br>
    I want to wear his initial <br>
    On a chain 'round my neck, chain 'round my neck <br>
    Not because he owns me <br>
    But 'cause he really knows me <br>
    Which is more than they can say, I <br>
    I recall late November <br>
    Holdin' my breath, slowly I said <br>
    "You don't need to save me <br>
    But would you run away with me?" <br>
    Yes (would you run away?) <br>
    <br>
    My baby's fit like a daydream <br>
    Walkin' with his head down, I'm the one he's walkin' to <br>
    (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it) <br>
    So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br>
    My baby's fly like a jet stream <br>
    High above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new <br>
    (Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it) <br>
    So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to <br>
    <br>
    Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want <br>

    I can see you standing, honey <br>
    With his arms around your body <br>
    Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all <br>
    <br>
    And it took you five whole minutes <br>
    To pack us up and leave me with it <br>
    Holdin' all this love out here in the hall <br>
    <br>
    I think I've seen this film before <br>
    And I didn't like the ending <br>
    You're not my homeland anymore <br>
    So what am I defending now? <br>
    You were my town <br>
    Now I'm in exile, seein' you out <br>
    I think I've seen this film before <br>
    <br>
    I can see you starin', honey <br>
    Like he's just your understudy <br>
    Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me <br>
    <br>
    Second, third, and hundredth chances <br>
    Balancin' on breaking branches <br>
    Those eyes add insult to injury <br>
    <br>
    I think I've seen this film before <br>
    And I didn't like the ending <br>
    I'm not your problem anymore <br>
    So who am I offending now? <br>
    You were my crown <br>
    Now I'm in exile, seein' you out <br>
    I think I've seen this film before <br>
    So I'm leavin' out the side door <br>
    <br>
    So step right out, there is no amount <br>
    Of crying I can do for you <br>
    All this time <br>
    We always walked a very thin line <br>
    You didn't even hear me out (you didn't even hear me out) <br>
    You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) <br>
    <br>
    All this time <br>
    I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind) <br>
    I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around) <br>
    'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs) <br>
    So many signs, so many signs <br>
    You didn't even see the signs <br>
    <br>
    I think I've seen this film before <br>
    And I didn't like the ending <br>
    You're not my homeland anymore <br>
    So what am I defending now? <br>
    You were my town <br>
    Now I'm in exile, seein' you out <br>

    You're talking shit for the hell of it <br>
    Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant <br>
    You're terrified to look down <br>
    'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare <br>
    Of everyone you burned just to get there <br>
    It's coming back around <br>
    <br>
    And I keep my side of the street clean <br>
    You wouldn't know what I mean <br>
    <br>
    'Cause karma is my boyfriend <br>
    Karma is a god <br>
    Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend <br>
    Karma's a relaxing thought <br>
    Aren't you envious that for you it's not? <br>
    Sweet like honey, karma is a cat <br>
    Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me <br>
    Flexing like a goddamn acrobat <br>
    Me and karma vibe like that <br>

    Spider-boy, king of thieves <br>
    Weave your little webs of opacity <br>

    Ask me what I learned from all those years <br>
    Ask me what I earned from all those tears <br>
    Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here <br>
    (I'm still, I'm still here) <br>
    <br>
    'Cause karma is the thunder <br>
    Rattling your ground <br>
    Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter <br>
    Karma's gonna track you down <br>
    Step by step from town to town <br>
    Sweet like justice, karma is a queen <br>
